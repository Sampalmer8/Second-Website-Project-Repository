        <h2 class="component-name">
          Central Processing Unit / Processor / CPU:
        </h2>

        <p class="component-description">
          The pocessor is what controls everything that happens in the computer.
          A better processor will run faster and load tasks faster. Faster
          processors also use more power and produce more heat.
        </p>

        <h2 class="component-name">
          Graphics Processing Unit / Graphics Card / GPU:
        </h2>

        <p class="component-description">
          The graphics card is in charge of displaying everything you see onto
          your monitor. High quality graphics cards are most commonly used for
          gaming and video rendering. Graphics cards, similarly to processors,
          use a lot of power and produce a lot of heat.

        <h2 class="component-name">Motherboard:</h2>

        <p class="component-description">
          The motherboard is the body of a PC. It connects all of the parts
          together and allows them to communicate. It also distributes power to
          all of the compenents when they need it. A good motherboard will have
          high power delivery and allow for more voltage to be sent to the CPU
          and GPU.

        <h2 class="component-name">Random Access Memory / RAM:</h2>

        <p class="component-description">
          Ram is short ter storage for tasks that are currently being performed.
          This involves things such as google, games and servers. Faster RAM
          allows information to be transfered faster. The recomended amount for
          a computer is 16 gigabytes but the maximum availible currently is 2
          terabytes.

        <h2 class="component-name">Power Supply Unit / Power Supply / PSU:</h2>

        <p class="component-description">
          The power supply is what gets plugged into the wall. It distributes
          power to the motherbord so all of the components recieve the power
          they need to perform how they want to. Better power supplies collect
          more watts and transfers the AC and DC power more efficiently.

          Storage: SSD / Solid State Drive and Hard Drives:
        </h2>

        <p class="component-description">
          SSDs and hard drives are both components that store the computers
          files and any files you download. SSDs are much faster than hard
          drives. Most modern computers now use SSDs called M.2 NVMe SSDs. They
          are fast and compact storage devices.

        <h2 class="component-name">Coolers, AIOs and Air Coolers:</h2>

        <p class="component-description">
          There are main types of coolers, air and water. Air Coolers transfer
          the heat through copper pipes and then to a radiator where the fans
          get rid of the heat from the radiator. Water coolers use water that
          goes through tubes which pick up the heat and then go to a radiator
          where fans blow away the heat from the radiator fins. Water coolers
          are much more efficient and effective because of the thermal
          conductivity of water, but they're also more expensive.
